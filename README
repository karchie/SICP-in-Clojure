Along with a klatch of like-minded nerds around St. Louis, I'm working
through the classic text Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programming, by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman.

I'm doing all this in Clojure, apparently because I want to grouse
about all the ways in which it's different from (and, I therefore
whine, inferior to) Scheme. Maybe by the time I reach the end of the
book I'll think the differences are improvements.

Some of the code here is written by me, and some of it is lifted from
the book. Of the former, none of it is code you'd want to put into
production. So consider it covered by a protection even stronger than
copyright: the Power of Suck.
